abstract = {An increase in the velocity of project delivery in the technology industry necessitates the adoption of novel methodologies by software development companies. In response, software testing underwent a significant paradigm shift to synchronize with expedited project timelines. The convergence of high-priority tests with tight deadlines has become increasingly common. To address this challenge, an Institute of Technology developed the AutoBOT Tool for automated functional testing of Android smartphones and tablets. Based on the Theory of Acceptance Model (TAM) and Goal-Question-Metric (GQM), the study collected qualitative and quantitative data to assess the impact of automation tools on delivery strategies in test teams. The results demonstrated that the adoption of AutoBOT resulted in a significant reduction of 2074 h in tester effort and an increase in productivity.},
